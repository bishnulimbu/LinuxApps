 xinput is needed to be installed in the terminal first.

1. first create a node packagejson by "npm init -y" command.

2. then create a file i.e. "keyboard_toggle.js"

3.paste the below code and save.

(optional change the permission if sudo privilege i.e. "chmod +x filename"

4.run the script i.e. node keyboard_toggele.js   viola it works or i hope so.

(optional) you can also set alias for it in your current shell rc file for instant code run.



also i am currently learning NodeJs and this was created mostly using some underhandly help(you know what i mean).
